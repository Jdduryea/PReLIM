Introduction
=============
After installing CluBCpG to your python environment there should not be a new set of command line tools on your PATH.
They all begin with ``clubcpg-``. Each one of them comes with a help command which displays the command line
arguments each tool accepts.

For example you can run

    .. code-block:: bash

        clubcpg-coverage --help
